Getting Started
================================

In order to get started with AIArena, it's necessary to install the AIOlympics library package.
This can be accomplished in one of two ways:
1. Running setup.py in PythonLibrary/aiolympics
2. Using pip

setup.py installation
---------------------

This provides the most up to date AIArena code and allows for quick updates when modifying the source code (ex. adding games, etc.)
