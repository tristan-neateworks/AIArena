This directory contains all documentation source files and tools necessary to generate and publish API docs to
sites like readthedocs.org. 
In order to use the scripts here, install the Sphinx package through pip. All other requirements should already 
be taken care of with a vanilla python installation. Once this step is complete, all that should be necessary to rebuild the documentation is to run the following in this directory:

$ make html

The makefile (or make.bat) allow for a wide variety of other build options.
